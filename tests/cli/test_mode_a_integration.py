"""Mode A integration test — drives `run` against the REAL Engine (not a MagicMock),
with a stubbed PreparedBundle so we don't hit any network or real provider.

Regression guard for the bug discovered during the 2026-05-19 cheatsheet
walk-through: single_turn.py called the fictional Engine.boot(provider=...)
classmethod and crashed with TypeError on first real invocation. The
pre-existing test suite missed it because every other Mode A test mocked Engine.
