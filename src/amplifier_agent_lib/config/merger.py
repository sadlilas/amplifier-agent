"""Layered merge of host config over bundle module configs (D5).

Per the host config design (``docs/designs/2026-06-01-host-config-layer-revisit.md``
\u00a7D5), the engine composes the effective module config at bundle-mount time
by overlaying the host's pass-through config on top of the bundle's static
config.  The bundle's declaration is the base; host overrides apply per
block, per key.

The merge is a **shallow** per-key overlay within each module block
(``{**bundle_static, **host_overrides}``).  There is no recursive
merging, no key renaming, no curation, and no schema translation:
amplifier-agent only parameterizes what ``bundle.md`` already declares
(D4 pass-through stance).  If the host wants to override a key that the
bundle exposes, it sets that key; otherwise the bundle default stands.

When the host did not provide a config tier at all (``host_config is None``,
returned by :func:`amplifier_agent_lib.config.load_config` when neither
``--config`` nor ``$AMPLIFIER_AGENT_CONFIG`` is present), the merge is a
no-op and the bundle module configs pass through unchanged.

``allowProtocolSkew`` is the one top-level host key that is **not** a module
pass-through -- it's engine-level and controls whether the engine boot path
enforces protocol version compatibility.  The merger surfaces it as a
separate return field so :mod:`amplifier_agent_lib._runtime.engine.boot` can
read the flag without re-parsing the host config dict (D4).
