bundle:
  name: amplifier-agent-builtin
  version: 1.3.0
  description: >
    Vendored opinionated manifest for the amplifier-agent CLI. Aligned with the
    upstream build-up-foundation experimental bundle
    (amplifier-foundation@main:experiments/build-up/behaviors/build-up-foundation.yaml,
    v0.4.0). Per the Strategy 1 decision
    (docs/designs/2026-05-19-baked-in-bundle-decision.md), the 4 behavior
    `includes:` upstream uses are inlined directly here — the bundle is
    self-describing without depending on foundation's named-bundle registry.
    The manifest text and the four sub-session agent definitions are vendored
    inside the wheel; every other module is git-cloned and pip-installed on
    first invocation. The prepared result is cached to
    ~/.amplifier-agent/cache/prepared/<aaa_version>/<sha256(bundle.md)>/
    (override the root via $AMPLIFIER_AGENT_HOME).
    Editing this file changes the cache key (sha256) and self-invalidates
    the warm pickle. AAA-specific additions beyond upstream parity:
    hook-context-intelligence for local-only event logging under the
    workspace tree (see docs/designs/2026-06-09-workspace-resolution-and-migration.md
    invariant I8 — unified per-session layout).

# Hooks declared inline (per Strategy 1 D6 — no `includes:` block, no registry

# OMITS the two hooks that write to stdout, which would break this CLI's
# JSON-output contract:
#
#   - hooks-streaming-ui (Thinking/ToolCall/TokenUsage blocks to stdout)
#   - hooks-todo-display (progress bar / border to stdout)
#
# Upstream is designed for a TUI host that consumes those bytes; our CLI
# emits JSON on stdout and diagnostics on stderr, so TUI hooks are an
# architectural mismatch. The remaining 5 hooks inject into the LLM's
# context or write to logging files — they don't touch stdout.

# amplifier-agent Built-in Bundle (Vendored Opinionated Manifest)

This bundle defines the runtime environment for the **amplifier-agent CLI**.
It mirrors the upstream **build-up-foundation** experimental bundle
(`amplifier-foundation@main:experiments/build-up/behaviors/build-up-foundation.yaml`,
v0.4.0), with the behavior `includes:` inlined directly per the Strategy 1
decision in `docs/designs/2026-05-19-baked-in-bundle-decision.md`. Module
sources use `@main`; upstream module updates flow automatically.

## Tool surface at the parent (orchestrator) level

The parent agent loads exactly two tools: `todo` (planning) and `delegate`
(sub-session dispatch). All concrete work — reading files, running commands,
searching, editing, running tests — goes through one of the four sub-session
agents below, each of which carries its own tool surface in its frontmatter.

| Agent | Tools (declared in frontmatter) |
|---|---|
| **parent** | `todo`, `delegate` (orchestration only) |
| `explorer` | `bash`, `filesystem`, `search`, `todo`, `delegate` (read-only) |
| `planner`  | `filesystem`, `todo`, `delegate` (design / spec / review) |
| `coder`    | `bash`, `filesystem`, `search`, `todo`, `delegate` (implementation from spec) |
| `tester`   | `bash`, `filesystem`, `search`, `todo`, `delegate` (verification, test gen) |

Agent definitions are vendored in `agents/{explorer,planner,coder,tester}.md`
adjacent to this file. Editing them changes the manifest content hash and
self-invalidates the warm cache.

## Delegation mechanics

The `delegate` tool spawns sub-sessions. Targets:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `agent="<name>"` (e.g. `"explorer"`) | One of the four bundled specialists |
| `agent="self"` | **Disabled at the parent level** — see `self_delegation.enabled: false` in the manifest. Sub-agents may still self-delegate. |

Context control:

| Parameter | Values |
|---|---|
| `context_depth` | `none`, `recent`, `all` |
| `context_scope` | `conversation`, `agents`, `full` |

- Independent subtask: `context_depth="none"`.
- Sub-session B sees sub-session A's output: `context_scope="agents"`.
- Self-delegation continuing heavy work (at sub-agent layer only): `context_depth="all", context_scope="full"`.

### Parallel dispatch

```python
delegate(agent="explorer", instruction="Check frontend", context_depth="none")
delegate(agent="explorer", instruction="Check backend", context_depth="none")
```

### Session resume

```python
r = delegate(agent="explorer", instruction="Start analysis")
delegate(session_id=r["session_id"], instruction="Now examine edge cases")
```

### Relay results

The user sees only your final response text. When a sub-session returns
findings, summarize them in your final response. Do not assume the user
saw raw tool output.

## Runtime context

The agent runs inside the `amplifier-agent` CLI process. Approval flows and
display updates are mediated by the host adapter — the component that bridges
agent-side events (tool calls, approval requests, stream chunks) to the host
application (e.g. the Paperclip VS Code extension or any compliant JSON-RPC
client).

## Bundle stability

This manifest text is **sealed per release**. Module `source:` URLs use
`@main`, so upstream module updates flow automatically — drift is intentional
product behaviour, not a defect. Editing this file changes the cache key
(sha256) and self-invalidates all cached prepared bundles. Any change must
be intentional and reviewed as a design decision.
