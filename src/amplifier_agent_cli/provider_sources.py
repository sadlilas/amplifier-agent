"""Provider name → module URI + config template mapping.

Used by ``modes/single_turn.py`` (and Mode B's inline ``_StdioEngine``) to
inject a provider entry into the prepared bundle's ``mount_plan["providers"]``
slot after ``load_and_prepare_cached()`` returns. The injection happens
per-invocation, so env-var-derived credentials are never baked into the
pickle cache on disk.

This mirrors:

* ``amplifier_app_cli.provider_sources.DEFAULT_PROVIDER_SOURCES`` (the
  name → git URI map),
* ``amplifier_app_openclaw.runner._inject_user_providers`` (the
  "don't clobber existing" mount injection),

but the source of truth here is ``provider_detect.detect_provider()`` — the
short provider name returned by the env-var precedence walk — not a
hand-rolled ``settings.yaml`` config. That keeps the CLI's documented
"set env var, run agent" UX (see CHEATSHEET §2) intact: zero settings
files, the user sets ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (or one of the supported peers)
and the matching provider module is mounted.

Per the broader baked-in-bundle architectural revisit
(``docs/designs/2026-05-19-baked-in-bundle-revisit.md``, D6), the
relationship between this catalog and app-cli's is itself a question for
that design pass; this module is the minimum-viable step that gets a
working CLI today without committing to either eventual answer.

    Resolves the env var declared in the catalog to its current value. The

    * the prepared-bundle pickle on disk never contains secrets,
    * users who export the env var after first install (or rotate keys)

    ``config`` dict containing ``api_key``, ``default_model``, and a

    mounted in this CLI, but the kernel reads the field).
