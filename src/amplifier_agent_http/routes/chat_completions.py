"""POST /v1/chat/completions -- the main endpoint.

Slice 2 implementation: real AmplifierSession-backed streaming.

Per request:
1. Parse OpenAI request, extract conversation history and the current prompt.
2. Create a per-request HttpQueueDisplaySystem fed by an asyncio.Queue.
3. Spawn the turn task: it constructs a fresh AmplifierSession, seeds it from
   the request's messages[], and runs session.execute(prompt).
4. Concurrently, drain the queue: translate each display event into an
   OpenAI SSE chunk and yield it to the client.
5. When the turn task completes, emit the final stop chunk (with the
   accumulated usage block) and the [DONE] terminator.

Cancellation discipline (basic for Slice 2; hardened in Slice 3):
- If the StreamingResponse generator is closed (client disconnect or task
  cancellation), the turn task is cancelled and the display queue is closed.
- The async generator's finally block runs even on cancellation, so cleanup
  is reliable.

    """Separate the conversation history from the current user prompt.

    Three cases the dispatcher distinguishes between:

    1. **Continuation after a host tool result** -- ``messages[-1].role == "tool"``.
       the host just ran a tool we delegated to it on the previous turn
       and is sending the result back. The LAST user message is upstream of
       the assistant-tool-call turn; the last few messages are
       ``[assistant w/ tool_calls, tool result]``. We must INCLUDE those in
       history (otherwise the LLM never sees its own tool call or the host's
       result and silently restarts the conversation -- the bug this branch
       was added to fix). Prompt is empty: we want the kernel's agent loop
       to re-enter the provider with the existing context, not append a fresh
       user turn.

    2. **Normal user turn** -- the last message is ``role="user"``. Everything
       before it is history; that last user message is the prompt.

    3. **No user message at all** (only system/assistant). Treat the whole list
       as history and use empty prompt. The kernel will likely error -- log a
       warning so the operator sees this.

    Policy 3b containment is applied to all three paths: client-supplied role=system
    messages are extracted, wrapped in user-supplied-instructions framing, and
    injected as a single role=user message at the START of history. The
    bundle's own system prompt remains untouched -- amplifier persona wins,
    the client's content is contained as user-supplied notes.

    Note on the empty-prompt path (Cases 1 and 3): the kernel's
    ``AmplifierSession.execute(prompt)`` will append ``prompt`` as a new user
    message before the next provider call. With ``prompt=""`` we still get a
    trailing empty user message -- the Anthropic provider tolerates this (it
    treats the empty text as a no-op continuation), but if a future provider
    rejects empty user content we may need to drive the orchestrator loop
    directly instead of going through ``execute``. v2 backlog.

    The kernel's context module expects OpenAI-shaped dicts. Pydantic gives us
    nicer access; we round-trip to dict before handing to the kernel.

    Two shape normalizations the kernel needs:

    1. **Assistant + tool_calls must carry a string ``content``.** OpenAI's
       wire encodes content-less assistant turns as ``"content": null`` and our
       Pydantic model accepts that. ``exclude_none=True`` then drops the field
       entirely. The kernel's internal ``Message`` model rejects the result --
       ``content`` is a required string field. We default to ``""`` so
       validation passes; the LLM only cares about ``tool_calls`` for this
       message anyway.

    2. **``tool_calls[].function`` (OpenAI shape) vs ``tool_calls[].tool``
       (kernel shape).** When the client's continuation POST replays a prior
       assistant turn, its ``tool_calls`` entries look like
