"""Per-request AmplifierSession lifecycle for the HTTP face.

This module owns the bridge between an incoming HTTP request and the
amplifier kernel's per-turn execution. It mirrors -- intentionally, by
copy-and-adapt -- the body of ``amplifier_agent_lib._runtime.make_turn_handler``
but adapts the seams to the HTTP face's needs:

- Conversation comes from the request's ``messages[]``, not from a disk
  transcript via SessionStore.
- No IncrementalSaveHook -- the HTTP face is stateless; persistence is
  the host's job.
- Display events are pushed to an asyncio.Queue (HttpQueueDisplaySystem),
  not written to stderr (CliDisplaySystem).
- Approval is auto-accept (HttpAutoApprovalSystem) for the POC.

The POC reuses one ``PreparedBundle`` across all requests (loaded once at
lifespan startup) but creates a fresh ``AmplifierSession`` per turn -- the
same pattern the existing CLI uses. Session reuse with conversation reset
is in the v2 backlog under "D6 boot split".

    Parameters
    ----------
    prepared:
        The PreparedBundle loaded once at process start. Holds the mount plan
        (modules, hooks, providers) and the agent overlay metadata.
    agent_configs:
        Hydrated agent overlays. Pass the result of ``hydrate_agent_configs``
        once at startup; reusing the same dict across requests is safe.
    history:
        The conversation prior to this turn, in OpenAI-compatible message
        shape (``role``, ``content``, optional ``tool_calls``, etc.). Loaded
        into the context module via ``set_messages``. May be empty for the
        first turn of a new conversation.
    prompt:
        The current user prompt (the last user message's content). This is
        what ``session.execute()`` receives.
    display:
        The DisplaySystem implementation for this request. Typically an
        HttpQueueDisplaySystem whose queue is being drained concurrently.
    approval:
        The ApprovalSystem for this request. POC uses HttpAutoApprovalSystem.
    session_id:
        Optional session id. If not provided, a random one is generated. The
        kernel uses this to tag events; persistent storage is not the HTTP
        face's responsibility.
    is_resumed:
        Whether to pass ``is_resumed=True`` to ``prepared.create_session``.
        When ``True`` the kernel treats this as a continuation of a prior
        session (append-mode events.jsonl, etc.). Defaults to ``False`` for
        backward compatibility — callers that do not send ``X-Client-Session-Id``
        get a fresh session every turn as before.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The assistant's reply text. Note that the same text has also been
        streamed via display events (``result/delta``); the return value is
        the final, complete assistant text.

    Raises
    ------
    Any exception raised by the kernel propagates. Cancellation
    (``asyncio.CancelledError``) propagates cleanly through the agent loop
    per the amplifier-expert audit.

    # of ONE ``create_session`` call.
    #
    # Lock semantics:
    #   - Lock holds only for the swap + ``create_session`` call (microseconds
    #     in practice -- ``create_session`` does cold mounts, not I/O).
    #   - Once ``create_session`` returns, the session has its own coordinator
    #     with the mounted modules baked in; subsequent requests can proceed
    #     without disturbing it.

    #     high concurrent request rates the next step would be per-request
    #     ``PreparedBundle`` cloning -- on the design backlog.

    #   list built by ``inject_provider(prepared, provider_id, model_override=
    #   upstream_model)``. ``provider_id`` is resolved at the chat_completions
    #   layer by looking the wire's ``model`` field up in
    #   ``app.state.served_models_registry`` (populated at lifespan from
    #   ``KNOWN_PROVIDERS``). On restore we reinstate whatever providers list
    #   was there at lifespan (empty list per the new lifespan -- providers
    #   are NOT pinned at lifespan now).

    # Workspace seeding (the correlation surface):
    #   ``hook-context-intelligence`` consults its own config during
    #   ``session:start``, which fires INSIDE ``create_session`` -- before any
    #   ``coordinator.config`` writes can land. We re-seed the hook's config
    #   here so the per-request effective workspace (base or
    #   ``<base>-<client-sid>`` when the X-Client-Session-Id header is in
    #   play) reaches the hook in time.

    # NOTE: We deliberately do NOT call ``prepare_bundle_for_session`` here.
    # The full prep (D4 mcp env + D5 merge_config + Fix C seed) was applied
